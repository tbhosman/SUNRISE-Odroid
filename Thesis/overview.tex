\subsection{Overview}
This thesis will start off with the general requirements of the system in the programme of requirements (\Cref{sec:requirements}). It will then give a general description of all the code modules, as well as the choices made regarding these modules (\Cref{sec:design}). This section will begin with a code overview (\Cref{sec:code_overview}) after which it will go into more detail regarding the weather station (\Cref{sec:weather_station}), Victron power management system (\Cref{sec:Victron}), solar panel temperature sensors (\Cref{sec:temp_sensors}), chargers (\Cref{sec:chargers}), local display (\Cref{sec:display}) and bash scripts (\Cref{sec:bash}). The thesis will then go over the validation tests and robustness of the system in the results (\Cref{sec:results}) after which they will be discussed (\Cref{sec:discussion}). The thesis will conclude in \Cref{sec:conclusions}, in which there will also be some future recommendations (\Cref{sec:future}).
