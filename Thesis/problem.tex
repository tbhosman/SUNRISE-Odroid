\subsection{Problem definition}
Team ODROID of the SUNRISE project group will focus on the local mini computer, which does all the data acquisition, as well as the control of the local display. It should also be able to control the chargers and register any charger that gets disconnected. It is important that there is a focus on robustness, because the system should run 24/7. A more detailed description can be found in \Cref{sec:requirements}.
